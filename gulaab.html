    <h1>GULAB JAMUN</h1>
    <h3 style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids, known as khoya, remain. The solids are kneaded with flour (maida), and small balls of this dough are deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature,[1] then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.[2] Hot gulab jamun is often served with vanilla ice cream, or kulfi.</h3>
